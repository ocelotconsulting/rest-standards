# REST

REST is a widely used architecture for web services which specifies how a client requests, creates, updates and deletes
resources from a server.  REST is not a protocol although it nearly always is implemented with HTTP. REST actually 
[does not have a formal specification](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/REST), and you will find that
API authors don't agree on many points.  The purpose of this short presentation is to:

1. Present the quasi-standards that are most widely accepted, and
2. Present some more subjective standards to start a discussion

For the purposes of this discussion I will assume that we're talking about HTTP with JSON used as the default data 
transfer format.
